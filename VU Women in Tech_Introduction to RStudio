##Using head function to check the dataset Airquality

head(airquality)

##Using Summarise function to understand the basic quality of the dataset

summary(airquality, na.rm = TRUE)

##Using filter function 

filter_1 = filter(airquality, Month < 5)

##Using two conditions to filter a dataset
filter_2 = filter(airquality, Wind > 10 & Month < 5)

##Using count function.  

count_1 = count(filter_1)
count_2 = count(filter_2)

##Using Arrange function 

arrange(filter_1, desc(Month))


##Creating a new variable by using Mutate function 

WindTemp = mutate(airquality, WindTemp = Wind + Temp)
##Creating a histogram 

hist(filter_1$Temp)
